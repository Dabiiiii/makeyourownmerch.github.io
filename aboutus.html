		<h1>ABOUT US</h1>

	<p><b>We the students from Bs infotech 2-A of Eulogio Amang Rodriguez Institute of Science & Technology<br>
	are the developers of the website MYOM (Make Your Own Merch). At first, we the developers came up<br> with
	the idea of developing the website MYOM because one of our members owned a business in which it<br> provides
	different designed of clothes, we just only planned to make a website that would be helpful in<br> improving
	our memberâ€™s business but in the process as we creating the website, we realized that our<br> website
	should not only be helpful for the business but also for those who have talents for designing.</b></p>
	<p><b>Through the use of our website, we provide an easy way for the costumers to patronize products<br>
	with the design they want also we make way for other creative people to show their talents in <br>
	designing and make their works to be appreciate.</b></p>
